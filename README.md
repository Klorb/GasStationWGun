Hello. If you found this somehow, welcome.

I am creating a game here that I intend to work on pretty often. I have never fully created a game, but I am trying to get into the space at some point.
I am building this game in Unreal Engine 5(UE5), I don't currently have a playable executable, so if you found this and would like to try it out, you will
currently have to download all of the UE5 files and open it from your own instance of UE5, which at that point, you could go ahead and start making your
own changes to my game. If you are someone who found this, and would like to make changes to my project, please help yourself. All I ask is that you don't
steal my game and that you give me credit on any work or techniques used.

My current vision for this game is that it will be very similar to working as a gas station clerk, yet one major difference from real life is that you have 
a gun at your disposal. I had this idea after reading a meme where someone asked if there were games where you play as a regular gas station employee,
but you have a gun with which to use. As a gas station clerk myself, this idea speaks to me in a certain way. I also want to take inspiration from the 
"Tales From The Gas Station" creepypasta story which I first heard about after listening to the Creep Cast episode on the story. I want to have a pretty
"regular" time working at the gas station, namely your tasks will include cleaning, stocking, and making sure customers are dealt with accordingly.

My second day spent working on the project. I was able to implement picking up and dropping items. I was able to give the item I created physics,
so when you run into it or drop the item, it moves based on physics. I started implementing a HUD. It currently shows up, but there is no actual
useful information on it yet, other than a prompt to interact with items that are interactable. I want to have a "use" progress bar, and I'm considering
adding health, task list, and time. I am also considering adding time and task list as items you have to look at or menus you have to open. I.E. a clock
you have to look at or a notepad with the task list.

This was the first day creating this project. I was able to implement an "interact" ability. It works with the door I implemented as well.
It uses a raycast system that sends a ray out every frame. If the ray is touching somehting you can interact with, it is interacted with
when you press "E". The map consists of the basic map template given to you, but I created a clerks counter with some really basic assets.
